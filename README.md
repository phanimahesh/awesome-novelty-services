# Awesome novelty services [![Awesome][awesome-badge]][awesome]
A list of awesome novelty services. Duh.

The links are added in no particular order.
This list is not awesome yet, but with enough contributions, it can be!
Please send PRs adding any novelty services you encounter.

> novelty |ˈnɒv(ə)lti| (n): the quality of being new, original, or unusual

For the purposes of this list, if something is unusual or funny, it belongs here.
Actually useful services may be included in a separate section if they are sufficiently interesting.

 - [SHOUTCLOUD](http://shoutcloud.io/) - ALL CAPS AS A SERVICE
 - [/dev/null as a Service](https://devnull-as-a-service.com/)
 - [Fuck Off As A Service](http://www.foaas.com/) provides a modern, RESTful, scalable solution to the common problem of telling people to fuck off.
